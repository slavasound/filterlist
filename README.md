# Press the Attack - Personal

RAW - `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/personal/presstheattack.txt`

This branch is created exclusively for my personal use. In it I will lay out filters which are not entered in the main branch - [master](https://github.com/bogachenko/presstheattack/tree/master). I don't want to clutter up "My filters" and so they will be uploaded here. Often, these filters remove conflicts between my subscriptions, and I have plenty of them. However, there are also filters that remove some functionality of sites for quick access to it.

**For this branch all PR will deviate, please do not create them here.**
